## Configuration Options

Configure your instance of the ixo-WebApp to suit your brand and marketplace.
The current configuration options include:

- Chain Services to specify the chain name, service endpoints, tokens, etc.
- Default payment currencies to be used in your marketplace
- Custom filters and tags
- Custom logo, header image, font and colour scheme
- Exchange settings for your market Impacts Exchange

## How to configure your marketplace

- Fork this Config repo to modify the Json config files with your settings.
- You can optionally add your config to this repo by submitting a Pull Request, or save the config to your own Github repo (or any other accessible file store).
  You will direct the app to get these files by specifying the endpoint when you create your Market Relayer.

## Configuration Editor

As a useful tool for edinting config files, use the basic [Configuration Editor](https://config-editor.ixo.earth/).
Note: This utility is still work in progress and will be further develped.
