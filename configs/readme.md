- Exchange settings for your market Impact Exchange

## How to configure your marketplace

- Fork this Config repo to modify the Json config files with your settings.
- You can optionally add your config to this repo by submitting a Pull Request, or save the config to your own Github repo (or any other accessible file store).
  You will direct the app to get these files by specifying the endpoint when you create your Market Relayer.
